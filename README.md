## SportsApp
With this application you can access information about a team from the NBA, NFL, MLB, and EPL. You'll be able to see the latest scores and team information. Also, you'll be able to access the team's website and the team's social media accounts.

## Motivation
This was created to display what I learned from my second unit of my Software Engineering Immersive Course. A fun way of doing this was making a sports app.

**Error**: ![alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/drxoihdbb/image/upload/v1585850370/Pictures/Screen_Shot_2020-04-02_at_10.58.58_AM_fwmug6.png)

**Resolutions**: Had to use a conditional in order to access the data that was pulled in.

if (!usLeague) {
        return <></>
    };
```
